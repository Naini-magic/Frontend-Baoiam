        Keep Showing Up Even When It’s Quiet

        This was never about getting it all right. It’s about continuing to show up, not just when it’s easy or public, but in the quiet moments too. Even when it’s awkward. Even when no one is watching.

        Inclusion isn’t a box you tick or a campaign you run once and forget. It’s something that lives in the everyday. In the small choices you make, the questions you are open to asking, and the things you are willing to rethink without needing to be told.

      <p className=" mx-auto max-w-3xl text-[16px] leading-relaxed">
        Non-binary students shouldn’t have to wait for the world to catch up just to feel like they belong. That feeling of being seen, respected, and included should already exist. Right now. In every classroom, every hallway, and every campus space that claims to care.
They deserve that now.
