        There’s a common mistake that schools make. Too often, non-binary students are the ones expected to do all the heavy lifting. Explaining themselves, correcting others, pushing for change, and leading every difficult conversation. And yes, their voices are important. But it’s unfair to place the entire responsibility on them to fix a system they didn’t create and that rarely supported them to begin with.

Real support isn’t just about saying the right things or nodding in agreement. It’s about actually following through and doing the work. It means taking action without waiting for students to ask again and again. No one should have to keep fighting just to be called by their actual name, to be treated with basic respect, or to feel okay walking into a bathroom. That responsibility doesn’t belong on their shoulders. It belongs to the institution.
